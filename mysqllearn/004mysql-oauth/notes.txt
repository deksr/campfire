There are two types.

1) Authentication without the user(just an application making a request). This is also called as two legged auth.

And authentication with the user(An individual makes a request). This is also called as three legged auth.

How o auth works:

Apps server sends a request consisting of client id no, secret no and code(no code no yet) to the gmail server.
Gmail server doesnâ€™t see see a session established, so sends a login popup.

app server sends the login info to the gmail server.
Gmail server authenticates and sends back authorisation request popup.

app server sends that authorisation request is granted to the gmail server.
gmail server sends the authorisation code in redirect url.

app server sends the client id, secret and code to the gmail server.
