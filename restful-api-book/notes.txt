Technical term for the thing named by a URL is "resource".

Whatever document the server sends, we call that document a "representation" of the resource. 

hypermedia:

303-it usually means "Operation has completed, continue elsewhere"

The application state: particular page (or to no page at all) being open in the browser window. 

The resource stare: urls are resources. when you make a post, it takes you to a new url with www.test.com/message/1234
This 1234 is a new url for individual message. Basically any state is called resource state.
