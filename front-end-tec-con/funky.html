	// 1) capture element/values from the dom and pass that as arguments to functions.
  // 2) when you recieve the data, add a method to it. 
  // 3) capture data from dom and create objects. you can also create prototype for objects. "prototype" and "new" are used together
  // 4) creating object using another object and then giving them super powers(this is more like making a photocopy of another object)
// 5) examples of how you can add new property to the object and another example to show how you can take a property from an object and use a function to do somethign with it




	// 1) capture element/values from the dom and pass that as arguments to functions.
	var captureClass = document.querySelector(".color-me");//capture an element using class

	function addingColor(captured){
		console.log(captured.innerHTML="nmcnm")
		
		function playAround(e){
      console.log(e)
		}

		captured.onmousemove= function(e){
					playAround(e)
		}
	}

  addingColor(captureClass)


// *********************
 // 2) when you recieve the data from server or from front end dom, add a method to it. 
// creating methods examples:
// when any object is present you can add a function from outside into the object
	
	var apple = {
		flesh: "juicy"
	}
	// here we are creating a function to apply inside the object
	apple.seed = function(){
		console.log("i am a seed")
	}




// // which is same same as this.But when you get a data it will not have function inside it. But we can create a function from outside and can apply this function to manipulate the data.

	var apple = {
		seed: function(){
			console.log("im also the seed")
		}
	}

	apple.seed();

	
// using this: this is used to refer to the object, i can then use this to refer to the value inside the object. This is useful when we are pulling the value from the same object into the function
	var apple = {
		flesh: "juicy",
		seed: function(){
			return this.flesh+ " " + "im also the seed"
		}
	}

	console.log(apple.seed())




// this is another way: here we are creating a function. and then we use the inbuilt method apply or call to 

	var mango = {
		flesh: "sweet and juicy",
	}


  function seed(greeting){
		return greeting + " " + this.flesh + " " + "im also the seed"
	}


  console.log(seed.apply(mango, ["hi"]))



// *********************
// 3) capture data from dom and create objects. you can also create prototype for objects. "prototype" and "new" are used together

// creating prototype:
// Creating object using function. Then we apply prototype on this constryctor functio to add a new method within the object. After thatw e can start creating objects pulling from thin air

	function ObjectTemplate (x, y){
		this.x = x,
		this.y = y
	}


	ObjectTemplate.prototype.z =function(somevalue){
		return this.x * this.y + somevalue
	}

  ObjectTemplate.prototype.abc = "random stuff"


	var twoByThree = new ObjectTemplate(2, 3)
	console.log(twoByThree.z(2))
  console.log(twoByThree.abc)

  twoByThree.abc = "specific" //you can change a property of the object and give it a new value
  console.log(twoByThree.abc) //this will show the new property
  console.log(ObjectTemplate.prototype.abc)//but it;s prototype is still random stuff




// *****************
// 4) creating object using another object and then giving them super powers(this is more like making a photocopy of another object)
// Creating objects using other object. Here we create a simple object. Then we create a new object.

	var watermelon  = { 
		flesh: "juicy",
		seeds: function(color){
	    return "I am " + color + " " + "in color"
		}
	}

  watermelon.price =  function(){
  	return "I'am very pricey"
  }

  var wmone = Object.create(watermelon);
  console.log(wmone.seeds("black"))
  console.log(wmone.price())



// ****************************
// 5) examples of how you can add new property to the object and another example to show how you can take a property from an object and use a function to do somethign with it


// simple example:

		var journal = [
	{events: ["work", "touched tree", "pizza", "running", "television"], squirrel: false},
	{events: ["work", "ice cream", "cauliflower", "lasagna", "touched tree", "brushed teeth"], squirrel: false}]
	

  // a) one way of adding a new property to an object
	for (var i = 0; i < journal.length; i++) {
	 journal[i].somepower = "fuck this is cool"
	 console.log(journal[i])
	};


	//b)  adding a new method. you can write functions and then use the data from the objects to do something with it(note how "this" works). After that you can use apply or call to take effect on the object. this doesnt add any new property to the object
	

	for (var i = 0; i < journal.length; i++) {
		journal[i].somepower = "fuck this is cool"

		// console.log(journal[i])
		console.log(hemanPower.apply(journal[i], ["fire"]))
		console.log(journal[i])
	};

		function hemanPower(getpower){
		return "i'm a he-man with" + getpower + this.somepower
	}
