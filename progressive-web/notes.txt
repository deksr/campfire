Cache-pwapp: I tried this with node. It doesn't work. 

http-server-cache - tried with http server. Works. Since the serviceworker.js file should be in the root file.

indexeddb-for-mobile: used this to check if db exists on mobile devices. 
$ npm install -g weinre. i used weinre to remote debug chrome iOS


inedxedb-learn: here i’m learning cookies, local storage and indexeddb

json-cahe-example: this works. I has indexed, service workers and everything working. You are done baby! :-)

learn-cache: here I’m learning cache-ing. There are two files. application-cache.html:this one is deprecated. Another file is cache-storage.html: for this refer to service-worker-basics. 

manifest-basic: learning manifest stuff

news-project: is my mini project. It is working but it doesn’t even need service workers. When the ajax fails then store. i have to add set time out(this bit is incomplete)

notes.txt: this note

push-notifications - I tried this but it is giving me errors. especially in the index file where i’m trying to register through getsubscription.

service-worker-basics: here i’m learning the basics of service workers. Although covered in news-project and your-first-pwapp, this has notes.

your-first-pwapp: this works. Go to work folder and start the google chrome server.
