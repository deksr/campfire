  This is the technology to use only on https and not http domains(i.e my domain should be https):
	During development you’ll be able to use service worker through localhost, but to deploy it on a site you’ll need to have HTTPS setup on your server.

Using service worker you can hijack connections, fabricate, and filter responses. Powerful stuff. While you would use these powers for good, a man-in-the-middle might not. To avoid this, you can only register service workers on pages served over HTTPS, so we know the service worker the browser receives hasn’t been tampered with during its journey through the network.
	

	<script>

if('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
	console.log("there is serviceworker present")
  navigator.serviceWorker
    // .register('/sw.js', {scope: './about'})
    .register('/sw.js')
    .then(function(registration) { 
      console.log("Service Worker Registered");
      console.log(registration); 
    })
    .catch(function (e) {
      console.error(e);
    })
  }
else {
    console.log('Service Worker is not supported in this browser.');
  }
