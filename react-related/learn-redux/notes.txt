Redux is a state management library that stores the entire state of your application in a single object tree known as a store. 


In flux architecture:

(S) Store: states are stored here.
(A) Action: is like the verb asking what action should take place on the data
(D) dispatcher: it is liek the gatekepper, takes in each action and updates teh store 


In is redux architecture:
(S) store: states are all stored in stores. it is stored in one state tree
(A) action: asking the permission to make change to the store(the verb) it asks what to do 
(R) reducers: the actual change that happens


note: You can't change the original store object. but you can only create a brand new store object.
