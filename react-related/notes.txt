for configuration follow this site: 
https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html

note: we need to have main.js file, index.html. look into react-webpage-simple folder and go by the same style.

once done start server with 
$ webpack-dev-server --progress --colour


and open at http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
